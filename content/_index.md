The main idea is to repeat the words or phrases until you remember them.

There are some key ways to do that using this app:

- The main method is to show you the word and its translation.
You have read it and decide how good you know this word. Depending on your decision the word will be shown to you sooner or later again. And you will refresh your memory until you decide you remember this word.


- Another very power way to learn words is to listen it like you listening the music or audio books. It use to be lots of cases when we just waste our time for the road or waiting for something etc. That is perfect opportunity to use this app and your phone like music player and learn the language simply listening the new words and its translation. It uses TextToSpeech(TTS) technology.

- It is important not just learn the meaning of the word but know how does it sound. So when you see the article for the word you can listen how it is pronounced. TTS will read the word for you.

- It is important not just learn the words and phrases itself but learn the ones you really need. The best opportunity to get such words right from the foreign language texts you trying to read. Just you see some unknown word you can immediately see its translation and add it into the lesson for the further learning. And keep reading do not switching into another app. Reading the real texts you will collect the really useful set of new words for learning.

- Sure the app can import good dictionaries and lessons for your learning right from the repository. So you can quickly start your learning with this app and easily build own small lessons based on large dictionaries and words you collect.
